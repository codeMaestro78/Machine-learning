# 🤖 Machine Learning Playground

Welcome to my **Machine Learning** repository!

This is my personal journey into the world of machine learning, where I implement models **from scratch** and also using **popular ML libraries** like Scikit-learn and XGBoost. The goal is to master both the **mathematics** and **practical coding** behind every ML algorithm.

---

## 🧠 What's in This Repository?

- ✅ Machine Learning algorithms **from scratch** (pure Python + NumPy)
- ✅ Implementations using **in-built libraries**
- ✅ Deep dives into the **maths** behind the models
- ✅ Well-commented code and markdown explanations

---

## 📅 Upload Schedule

I will be uploading content on a **daily** or **alternate-day** basis.

Each upload may include:
- ✅ A new ML model (from scratch or using libraries)
- ✅ A mathematical explanation in Markdown
- ✅ Jupyter notebooks or `.py` files with visualizations and code

---

## 🧭 Learning Roadmap

### ✅ Phase 1: Supervised Learning
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

### ✅ Phase 2: Unsupervised Learning
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- DBSCAN
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### 🔜 Phase 3: Reinforcement Learning **or** Deep Learning (TBD)
After completing supervised and unsupervised models, I’ll begin exploring either:
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Q-Learning, SARSA, Policy Gradients  
  *or*
- **Deep Learning**: Neural Networks, Backpropagation, CNNs, RNNs, Autoencoders
