    "# ðŸ“Š Probability: Key Topics, Formulas, and When to Use Them\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide covers fundamental probability concepts, their formulas, and when to apply them.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Basic Probability\n",
    "This is the foundation for calculating the likelihood of a single event.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ Formula\n",
    "The probability of an event *A* is the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total possible outcomes.\n",
    "$$P(A) = \\frac{\\text{Number of Favorable Outcomes}}{\\text{Total Number of Outcomes}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### âœ… When to Use\n",
    "Use this rule when all outcomes are **equally likely**.\n",
    "* **Examples:** Tossing a fair coin, rolling a standard die, or drawing a card from a well-shuffled deck.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Complement Rule\n",
    "This rule helps find the probability that an event will *not* occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ Formula\n",
    "The probability of the complement of event *A* (denoted $A^c$) is 1 minus the probability of *A*.\n",
    "$$P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### âœ… When to Use\n",
    "Use this when it's simpler to calculate the probability of the event **happening** and then subtract it from 1.\n",
    "* **Example:** What is the probability of *not* rolling a 6 on a die? It's easier to find the probability of rolling a 6 ($1/6$) and calculate $1 - 1/6 = 5/6$.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Addition Rule\n",
    "This rule is for finding the probability of at least one of two events occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ Formula\n",
    "The probability of event *A* or event *B* occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities minus the probability of both occurring together.\n",
    "$$P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)$$\n",
    "*Note: If events A and B are **mutually exclusive** (cannot happen at the same time), then $P(A \\cap B) = 0$, and the formula simplifies to $P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### âœ… When to Use\n",
    "Use this to find the probability of **either A or B** (or both) happening.\n",
    "* **Example:** What is the probability of drawing a King or a Heart from a deck of cards?\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Conditional Probability\n",
    "This measures the probability of an event occurring, given that another event has already occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ Formula\n",
    "The probability of event *A* given that event *B* has occurred is:\n",
    "$$P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### âœ… When to Use\n",
    "Use this when the outcome of one event **affects the probability** of another.\n",
    "* **Example:** What is the probability that a student passed a test (*A*), given that they studied (*B*)?\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "This theorem describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. It's a way to \"reverse\" conditional probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ Formula\n",
    "$$P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(B \\mid A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### âœ… When to Use\n",
    "Use this for updating probabilities based on new evidence.\n",
    "* **Applications:** Medical diagnoses (e.g., probability of a disease given a positive test), spam filtering, and machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Multiplication Rule (for Intersections)\n",
    "This rule is used to find the probability that two (or more) events will occur together. The formula depends on whether the events are independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ Formulas\n",
    "* **For Independent Events:** If events *A* and *B* do not influence each other.\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B)\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "* **For Dependent Events:** If the outcome of event *A* affects the outcome of event *B*.\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B \\mid A)\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### âœ… When to Use\n",
    "Use this to find the probability of **both A and B** happening.\n",
    "* **Independent Example:** The probability of flipping two heads in a row.\n",
    "* **Dependent Example:** The probability of drawing two aces from a deck without replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Permutations and Combinations\n",
    "These are used for counting outcomes, which is essential for calculating basic probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ Formulas\n",
    "* **Permutations (Order Matters):** The number of ways to arrange *r* items from a set of *n* items.\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    _n P_r = \\frac{n!}{(n - r)!}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "* **Combinations (Order Doesn't Matter):** The number of ways to choose *r* items from a set of *n* items.\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    _n C_r = \\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### âœ… When to Use\n",
    "* Use **permutations** when the sequence is important (e.g., arranging letters in a word, finishing places in a race).\n",
    "* Use **combinations** when the sequence is irrelevant (e.g., picking a committee of 3 people from a group of 10, choosing lottery numbers)."
