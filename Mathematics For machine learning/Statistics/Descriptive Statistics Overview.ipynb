    "Descriptive Statistics Reference\n",
    "Overview\n",
    "This document provides a clear and concise reference for descriptive statistics concepts and their formulas, covering types of data, measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion, skewness, and kurtosis. Formulas are formatted in LaTeX using dollar signs for proper rendering in Markdown viewers that support LaTeX (e.g., GitHub, Visual Studio Code with Markdown+Math extension, or Jupyter Notebook). This is intended for use in statistical analysis, data science, or academic studies.\n",
    "Types of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Qualitative Data: Non-numerical data describing categories or qualities, such as colors, names, or labels.\n",
    "Quantitative Data: Numerical data representing quantities, categorized as:\n",
    "Discrete: Countable values (e.g., number of students).\n",
    "Continuous: Measurable values within a range (e.g., height, weight).\n",

    "Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "This document serves as a reference for statistical analysis in research, data science, or academic studies.\n",
    "Formulas can be implemented in programming languages like Python (using libraries like NumPy or SciPy), R, or statistical software.\n",
    "Ensure your Markdown viewer supports LaTeX rendering to view formulas correctly (e.g., GitHub, VS Code with Markdown+Math extension, or Jupyter Notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Distinguish between population and sample formulas (e.g., variance and standard deviation) based on your dataset.\n",
    "Skewness and kurtosis formulas assume sample data; adjust denominators for population data if needed.\n",
    "For practical implementation, use statistical libraries like NumPy or SciPy in Python or functions in R for efficient computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rendering Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Viewing Formulas: Formulas are formatted in LaTeX using $ for inline expressions (e.g., $ \\bar{x} $) and $$ for display equations (e.g., $$ \\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n} $$). Use a LaTeX-compatible Markdown viewer, such as:\n",
    "GitHub: Upload to a repository or Gist.\n",
    "Visual Studio Code: Install the \"Markdown+Math\" extension.\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook: Paste content into a Markdown cell.\n",
    "Overleaf: Copy formulas into a LaTeX document.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Troubleshooting: If formulas appear as raw text (e.g., \\bar{x}), your viewer may not support LaTeX. Try a supported platform or request an alternative format (e.g., plain text or PDF).\n"
